Write a point of view considering the positions of {{user}} and {{char}}. However, if there is no additional viewpoint change due to {{user}} or if there is no description suggesting a viewpoint change, do not add viewpoint-related tags.

- When describing clothing, write "type of clothing, state of clothing (inclusive)" (e.g. tight yoga pants, pants pull).

- Keywords to describe the situation should be written without text, sound, scene, and loudly (e.g. struggling, bedroom, moaning, wet pussy, rhythmic thrusting ). 

- To better express {{char}}'s feelings, describe {{char}}'s feelings in detailed and simple words. It also includes facial expressions that indirectly express emotions, such as “shaded face, wavy mouth, nose blush”. Also consider the emotional intensity of {{char}} to emphasize or weaken it.

If sexual tags are included, be sure to add the “nsfw” tag.

- Unless otherwise specified, the use of tags referring to persons other than {{char}} is prohibited. However, the use of additional male-only tags, including “1boy,” is permitted only when sexual intercourse or an act equivalent to sexual intercourse occurs. In this case, add other tags starting with “1boy”.
